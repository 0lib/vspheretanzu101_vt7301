Welcome to the course template for your new course. 

At the current time, the course template is based on a copy of the vSphere with Tanzu 101 course. 

Please use the included pages in this template as a reference. Modify, delete or add pages to customize the content with your desired course materials. Detailed instructions for this template can be found at [https://docsy.dev](https://docsy.dev).

Once you have completed preparing your desired content and have verified it is ready for live publication, please edit the course catalog card on the modernappsninja/modernappsninja.gitub.io repository and set `draft: true` and submit a pull request to have your course published to the course catalog. 

If you have any questions or need any assistance, please open an issue ticket on the [https://github.com/modernappsninja/modernappsninja.gitub.io](https://github.com/modernappsninja/modernappsninja.gitub.io) repository.
